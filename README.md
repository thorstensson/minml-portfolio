#Portfolio Vue 2

This  current Vue portfolio is in Vue 2; a Vue 3 version will come in June. I will also be uploading some Vue components in the weeks to come. I do not take credit for the Three animation, which I originally found on CodePen, and simply rewrote into a Vue component. It needs more work, a new image; working on it. Working, working.
